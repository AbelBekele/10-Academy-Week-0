## Goals to Achieve

- **MLOps & Pipelines:** Explore MLOps components, analysis pipelines for efficient data processing.
- **Data Science Skills:** Enhance time series analysis, message classification, and statistical thinking.
- **ML Engineering Proficiency:** Implement feature stores, model versioning, monitoring, CI, Dockerization, and package building.
- **ML Model Excellence:** Build accurate, interpretable, and scalable ML models.
- **MLFlow Versioning:** Utilize MLFlow for effective model versioning, ensuring traceability and reproducibility.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these installation steps:

1. **Python Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv your_env_name
    ```

    Replace `your_env_name` with the desired name for your environment.
    
    **Activate the environment:**

    - On Windows:

    ```bash
    .\your_env_name\scripts\activate
    ```

    - On macOS/Linux:

    ```bash
    source your_env_name/bin/activate
    ```

2. **Clone this package**
    To install the `network_analysis` package, follow these steps:

    1. Clone the repository:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/AbelBekele/10-Academy-Week-0.git
        ```
    2. Navigate to the project directory:
        ```bash
        cd 10-Academy-Week-0
        ```
    
    3. Install the required dependencies:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```


3. **Continuous Integration:**
    - CI/CD configurations are already set up. Refer to the CI/CD documentation for additional details.

## Usage

### Branches

In this repository, the branches are organized as follows:

- **main:** The main branch
    - Containing all working and updated branch pushes    

- **task-1:** The branch for Day 1 analysis.
    - **Dev Environment Setup:** Successfully set up the Python environment, Git version control, and CI/CD.
    - **Relevant Skills Demonstration:** Showcase proficiency in the CRISP-DM framework, data understanding, EDA techniques, and statistical thinking.
    - **Project Planning - EDA & Stats:** Effectively plan and execute the project using the CRISP-DM framework, perform EDA, and derive actionable insights from statistical analyses.

- **task-2:** The current branch for Day 2 analysis. 
    - 

  ```bash
  git checkout -b task-2
    ```
### Code Organization

Restructured the code by moving functions into `/src/loader.py` and `/src/utils.py`. In the analysis notebooks, used the `SlackDataLoader` from `/src/loader.py` and functions from `/src/utils.py` for data loading needs.

## Notebooks
### Day 1 Analysis
  - `/notebooks/EDA.ipynb`
### Day 2 Analysis
  - `/notebooks/Time difference analysis.ipynb`
  - `/notebooks/ML model task2.ipynb`
